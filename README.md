# SudokoSolver_202401100300271
 The goal is to develop an algorithm to solve a Sudoku puzzle automatically within a mobile game. The puzzle consists of a 9x9 grid, where some cells are filled with numbers (1-9) and others are empty (represented by 0). The solver must identify the empty cells, validate potential numbers for each cell based on Sudoku rules (no repeated numbers in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid), and fill in the numbers using a backtracking approach.
The backtracking algorithm attempts placing numbers in the empty cells. If a number is valid, the solver proceeds to the next empty cell. If placing a number leads to a conflict later, it backtracks and tries a different number. The algorithm continues until the board is completely filled or it determines that no solution exists.
